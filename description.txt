Small mod that adds two new armour sets.

Both of them share the same effects of the mining set (with Ultrabright Helmet), but have increased defense to scale with enemies in hardmode.

The Advanced Mining Set takes the original Mining Set (with Ultrabright Helmet, instead of Mining Helmet) plus some Granite and Silk to create.

The Shroomite Digging Set takes the Advanced Mining Set and some Shroomite Bars, along with some Souls of Sight for the helmet.
